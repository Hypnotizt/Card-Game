## KEYWORD COSTING GUIDE

When adding keywords to creatures, reduce stats accordingly:

| Keyword | Approximate Cost |
|---------|-----------------|
| Haste | -1 stat |
| Flying | -1 stat |
| Drain | -1 to -2 stats |
| Deathstrike | -2 stats |
| Guard | -0 to -1 stat |
| Regenerate | -1 stat |

Example: A 3-cost creature normally has 6-7 total stats.
With Haste, it might be 3/3 (6 stats - but feels like 7 due to immediate impact).
